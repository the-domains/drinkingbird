# Technology often exploits our psychological vulnerabilities to control our actions.

How?

1\. by giving us menus with many choices that make us think that those are the only or best choices available. we don't ask ourselves "what's not on the menu?" = what other choices do we have?  
2\. by linking user actions (like pulling a lever or scrolling a social network feed) with a variable reward. Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of reward is most variable (think of slack's /giphy command).  
3\. by convincing us that they're channel for important information that we would regret missing  
4\. by creating social exposure for users and making us vulnerable to needing to be approved or appreciated by our peers  
5\. by creating social obligations for users and making us vulnerable to needing to reciprocate other's gestures  
6\. by creating infinite experiences that keep us consuming them even when we don't need them anymore  
7\. by interrupting us so we respond immediately  
8\. by bundling the thing that the business wants users to do with those that users want to do. so that when users want to do something, they first have to do something else, which is good for the business.  
9\. by adding frictions to users' choices that are not good for the business  
10\. by engaging users with small, quick requests and then escalating from there to make them stay longer
